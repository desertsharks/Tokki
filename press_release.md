Agile Insight
=====================
### Using Real-Time Data to Improve Presentations ###
note: this is not real yet.
## Summary ##
We give presenters better insight into their audience engagement.  This gives the presenter the ability to improve and react on the fly.  They may review the data to identify areas of weakness.

## Problem ##
Events lack real-time engagement data.

## Solution ##
We collect real-time participant data to relay to presenters. Data is available for future analysis.

  - Let the data flow!

## Customer Quote ##
  > I was able to improve my comedy routine, "Magic of the Magician" by knowing which parts of my show were the favorite of my audience!  I could easily see which parts of my show were crisp, and which parts put them to sleep!
